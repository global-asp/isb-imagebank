# ISB Image Bank - Images from the Indigenous Storybooks Collection

This is a repository of open-licensed images derived from the stories in the [Indigenous Storybooks](https://indigenousstorybooks.ca/) collection. All of the original artwork was contributed by [Little Cree Books](http://littlecreebooks.com/) under an open license. In addition, black and white illustrations in the original collection have been colourized by Ingrid Schechter.

## Source

The image bank was created as a in the process of generating stories for [ISB Source](https://github.com/global-asp/isb-source) and the [Indigenous Storybooks](https://indigenousstorybooks.ca) website.

There are similar imagebanks available for the [African Storybook](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank), [Pratham Books](https://github.com/global-asp/pb-imagebank), as well as the repository for the original unedited images from [Little Cree Books](https://github.com/global-asp/lcb-imagebank), which this repository has been modelled on.

## Image sizes

Since the original images are relatively large, they have been made available in this repository in two different sizes for convenient re-use in other applications. The original size images are in the `large` folder. The images in the `medium` folder are approximately half the size of the corresponding images in the `large` folder.
